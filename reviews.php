        <p> I have always thought that getting a website created for a company could be one heck of a job, considering the back and forth required to properly convey the Brand Image. Never knew that it could be as easy as ordering a product on eBay :) A Huge Thanks to designdok! You guys have done an excellent job</p>

                               Best experience working with Design Dok. The turnaround for my logo concepts was fast and I was offered multiple logo concepts each time. they asked for feedback on the concepts and zeroed in on what I wanted. I am happy with the final product! It was exactly what I was looking for! I recommend Design Dok for your project.

I have used Design Dok for various projects. I've found them to be a proactive asset to my business with a superb can-do attitude to the short deadlines we work to. The standard of Design Dok’s creative work is excellent. They are more than willing to see projects from concept to completion. They have even been on site for installation projects to manage and oversea the final product.

It starts with the best customer centric philosophy - you can't create great software without first understanding the customers business need, budget, and time limitations. Design Dok has filled out their ranks with developers, designers, project managers, client coordinators, and supervisors who are not only true, passionate nerds who love tech but also who really care about delivering business results. I'm proud to say I've worked with Design Dok for 6+ Months, starting just one conceptual mobile project and moving upwards towards creating game-changing Mobile App for clients all across the US. Highly recommended team!

I am a creative writer too but due to lack of time, I had to order my book. I was conscious in the beginning whether this company Design Dok would be able to stand on my expectations or not. But the moment I got my first draft I has truly impressed with their level of work and flawlessness. They have made my idea shine with creativity and a superior writing style.

I was fortunate enough to find design dok by responding to an email I received. After they successfully completed the first two (2) videos I was so happy with their work. I did 9 more videos for a total of 11. I'm already planning my next 12 projects. These guys are amazing with Mark at the helm. They will have me as a client for as long as they offer the service.

                      Design Dok did impress me by their professionalism, competency and responsiveness. They listened to my needs and took all my comments immediately into consideration.

I can only recommend Design Dok and I#m grateful for this experience - well done!!

I gained some insight into the practices of our industry's foremost link development consultants. I was able to see for myself that the SEO guys at Design Dok are for real and they've done a good job of consolidating theory with evidence and thereupon manifesting best practices for link development.
